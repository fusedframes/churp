Terms of Service
================

_Last updated: July 21st, 2025_

This is a contract between you and FusedFrames Ltd (“we”, “us”, or “FusedFrames”), the sponsor of Churp. By using the website at https://churp.dev (the “Website”) or the Churp format, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the “Terms of Service”).

## Scope and Licence

These Terms of Service govern your use of the Website and the Churp format, a JSON-based content standard that allows AI systems to understand and interact with products and services. Unless otherwise stated, all code, specifications and related materials published under the Churp project are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 (AGPL-3.0). To view a copy of this licence, please visit https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3.

This licence ensures that anyone is free to use, study, share and modify the Churp format, provided that any distributed or hosted modifications are also made available under the same AGPL-3.0 licence, with publicly accessible content fields, content field definitions, content field values, field structure guidelines and related technical documentation. All users and contributors are required to respect and comply with the terms of the AGPL.

By submitting contributions to Churp (including, but not limited to, code, documentation, and examples), you agree that your contributions may be distributed under the same AGPL-3.0 licence. FusedFrames makes no patent claims, nor does it assume responsibility for implementations or third-party use.

## Changes to Website, Terms and Format

We may modify or terminate the Website, the Churp format or any part of these Terms at any time and without notice. You agree to be bound by any revised Terms of Service when posted. However, no modification will retroactively affect the AGPL-licensed rights you have received for past versions or uses of Churp.

We reserve the right to update the format, including changes that may affect compatibility with prior versions. While backward compatibility is encouraged, we are not obligated to maintain it. We are not responsible for supporting or recognising any third-party implementations.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

The Churp format, the Website and all related materials are provided “as is” without any warranties. FusedFrames disclaims, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all express, implied and statutory warranties, including, but not limited to, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. We do not warrant the accuracy, reliability, or performance of Churp or its supporting materials. You assume full responsibility for your use of the format and Website.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, FusedFrames shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages arising from your use or misuse of the Churp format or Website. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of data, loss of profits, business interruption or the cost of substitute goods or services, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. This limitation applies regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort or otherwise.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some of the above terms may not apply to you.
