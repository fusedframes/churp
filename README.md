Churp
=====

Churp is an open-source schema specifically designed to enable AI systems to accurately understand, present and interact with products and services across the web. Churp provides structured, AI-optimised product and service data. It directly addresses common challenges in conversational commerce, such as data hallucinations, inaccurate pricing, ineffective media rendering and inefficient data processing. This ensures reliable and ethical interactions.

## Why Use Churp?

Using Churp significantly reduces the risks associated with relying on unstructured data or general-purpose schemas not optimised for conversational commerce. It prevents costly errors such as incorrect pricing or misleading product details, while providing structured data to help mitigate unethical or noncompliant situations. Churp's structured format is lightweight, computationally efficient and straightforward to integrate, making it ideal for conversational AI systems. Potential use cases include product upsells, clarifying product dependencies and enabling immediate actions such as placing an order.
